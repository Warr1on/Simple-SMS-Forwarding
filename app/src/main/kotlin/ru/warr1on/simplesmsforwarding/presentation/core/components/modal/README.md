# Modal components

This is my added experimental components for showing and handling modals, slightly adapted to be used here.

The things to note about it: firstly, it depends on Compose's Material2 library, secondly, it liberally uses experimental APIs from Material2; and thirdly, the comments are all in Russian as of now, so, if you somehow happened to stumble upon this piece of code and would like to get some clarifications about it, feel free to email me at warr1on@icloud.com

Eventually it should be moved into a standalone repo and probably reworked to not depend on Material2, or at least not depend on experimental APIs as much.
